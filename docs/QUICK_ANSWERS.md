## 1️⃣ **Field Comparison: Android App vs PWA**

### ✅ GREAT NEWS: PWA is BETTER!

**Your PWA has MORE fields than the Android app in almost every category!**

| Category | Android Fields | PWA Fields | Status |
|----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| **Banks** | 11 | 11 | ✅ Perfect Match |
| **Cards** | 8 | 8 | ✅ Perfect Match |
| **Policies** | 7 | 7 | ✅ Perfect Match |
| **Aadhaar** | 6 | 8 | ✅ PWA has 2 MORE (VID, enrollment #) |
| **PAN** | 3 | 5 | ✅ PWA has 3 MORE (PAN #, DOB, father) |
| **License** | 4 | 7 | ✅ PWA has 4 MORE (dates, classes, state) |
| **Voter ID** | 4 | 6 | ✅ PWA has 3 MORE (DOB, constituency, state) |
| **Misc** | 5 | 7 | ✅ PWA redesigned (URL, username, password) |

### ⚠️ ONE MISSING FEATURE: Document Upload

**Android app has `documentPath` field in 5 categories:**
- Aadhaar ❌
- PAN ❌
- License ❌
- Voter ID ❌
- Misc ❌

**What you need to add:**
- File upload component
- Image/PDF support (max 10MB)
- Encrypted storage in IndexedDB
- Preview/download functionality

**Estimated work:** 8 hours

**See detailed analysis in:** `FIELD_COMPARISON.md`

## 2️⃣ **Which Categories Need Document Upload?**

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Have):
1. **Aadhaar** - Upload scanned Aadhaar card image
2. **PAN** - Upload PAN card image
3. **License** - Upload driving license image
4. **Voter ID** - Upload voter ID card image
5. **Misc** - Upload any document type

### 🟡 OPTIONAL (Nice to Have):
6. **Banks** - Upload bank statements, passbooks
7. **Cards** - Upload card images (front/back)
8. **Policies** - Upload insurance policy documents

### Implementation Details:

**Supported file types:**

### ❌ Why NOT GitHub Pages?

- ❌ Slower (no global CDN)
- ❌ Limited to 100 GB bandwidth
- ❌ No preview deployments
- ❌ No built-in analytics
- ❌ Harder to configure
- ❌ Basic DDoS protection

### Alternative: Vercel (Also Excellent)

If you prefer Vercel:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```
